Registration for this event is now full.  We have more people waiting than we are likely to get cancellations.   

If you already got an email saying you are on our waiting list this remains valid. You may still get a place if someone cancels.  


### Important

* Selling your registration
    * If you already paid and can no longer attend, you can transfer your registration to another hasher. Please email us with the other Hasher's details and we will contact them directly.  Once your name is off the "Who's coming" list and the other hasher's name appears, their registration is confirmed.  You can ask them to pay you the same fee as you paid us.   
    * If you do not have someone else to sell your registration to let us know and we will try and sell it to someone on the waiting list.  Once we receive payment from the person on the waiting list we will refund you.  
    * We can not refund you until someone takes your registration. 
* Minimum Age
    * In keeping with Irish law, this event is only suitable for adults over 18 years

#### Disclaimer
Hashing is NOT a guided activity, nor is it led by professionals. If you take part in a Hash run or walk you do so of your own free will, voluntarily and fully aware that it is not guided.

The Dublin Hash House Harriers merely schedules the activity and publishes details of the same.

We remind you that running, especially in mountains or outdoor areas, carries inherent risks. By taking part, you accept those risks and are responsible for your safety.
