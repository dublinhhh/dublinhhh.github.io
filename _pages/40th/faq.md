<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Q: I would like to book accommodation, as we are a couple can we have a double room?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <strong>A:</strong> All rooms are single rooms within a 2, 3 or 4 bedroomed apartment. If you let us know you are a couple we will endeavour to have you in the same apartment. You will each have a single bed (bedroom) see accommodation photographs.<br><br>
    If this is not suitable you may wish to register without accommodation and book your own. The hash accommodation is in the city centre. Any hotel within 1km of O'Connel Bridge should be suitable.

  <div class="faq-question">Q: We are a couple with a 10 year old son, we would love to bring him. I notice it says you must be over 18 years. We are happy to get our own accommodation if this helps?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <strong>A:</strong> Sorry due to Irish law re child protection and pub licensing, we would need special insurance and child safeguarding officers to have children at the event. Children should not be in pubs after 9pm in Ireland.

  <div class="faq-question">Q: Is it easy to get from the Airport to the Accommodation?</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Q: I notice the accommodation comes without breakfast, can you book mine with breakfast?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <strong>A:</strong> No, all need to be reserved and booked the same. Breakfast is available in the dining room near the accommodation. The reason we did not include breakfast it was quite expensive for a "full" breakfast and many people may not want that. Breakfast may be purchased per item which will be cheaper for most, also there is a small kitchen and fridge in your accommodation you can bring in food yourself or dine out in Temple Bar or Grafton St area. Very pleasant terraced coffee shops in the summer!

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">Q: I would like to do the Sunday morning run, however, my flight is at 1200 to New York. Will I have time?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <strong>A:</strong> No, our trail will probably start mid morning and go on to lunch time. It takes 20 â€“ 40 mins to get to the Airport depending on how you travel. The airport is VERY busy â€“ we are an Island ðŸ˜Š So there can be queues. For travelling with hand luggage its best to be arriving at least 1.5 to 2 hours before your departure, if you have luggage to drop its best to go earlier.
