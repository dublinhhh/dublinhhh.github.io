#### Disclaimer
Hashing is NOT a guided activity, nor is it led by professionals. If you take part in a Hash run or walk you do so of your own free will, voluntarily and fully aware that it is not guided.

The Dublin Hash House Harriers merely schedules the activity and publishes details of the same.

We remind you that running, especially in mountains or outdoor areas, carries inherent risks. By taking part, you accept those risks and are responsible for your safety.
