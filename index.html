<h1>Dublin Hash House Harriers</h1>

<p>
Dublin HHH was founded on 8th March 1986 and is now the only hash which runs in
Ireland on a regular basis. A hash is "Drinkers with a running problem" - the
ultimate fun running club for people who enjoy social interaction more than
keeping fit!
</p>

<p>
The Dublin HHH Club welcome visitors and new members. This web page is designed
so that you can find out where we're running and how to contact us. If you're
visiting, you'll find that there is useful tourist information. Tell me what you
enjoyed in Ireland and I'll add it to the list.
